In this section, we're going to go one by one through a series of tips that will help you avoid common pitfalls (or gotchas!) in pipelines. These tips will help you in the next sections and in future work. A quick list of what's to come:


- :mag: How to debug in a pipeline
- :eyes: Visualizing and understanding the status of dependencies in a pipeline
- :speech_balloon: `which_dirty()` and `why_dirty()` to further interrogate the status of pipeline targets
- :arrows_clockwise: What is a cyclical dependency and how do I avoid it?
- :warning: Undocumented file output from a function 
- :open_file_folder: Using a directory as a dependency 
- :clipboard: Can I _really_ only use filenames or object targets as arguments in pipeline functions? Understanding the `I()` helper
- :unlock: The `target_name` special variable. Simplifying `target`:left_right_arrow:`command` relationships and reducing duplication
