You should now have a working pipeline that can run with `scmake()`. Your current pipeline likely only has one file target, which is the final plot. 

We want you to get used to exchanging objects for files and vice versa, in order to expose some of the important differences that show up in the remakefile and also in the way the functions are put together. 


:keyboard: Activity: Open a PR where you swap two object targets to be file targets, and change one file target to be an object target. Run `scmake` and open a pull request. Paste your build status as a comment to the PR and assign Jordan or Alison as a reviewer.
