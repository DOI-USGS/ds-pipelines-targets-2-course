### Set up your local environment before continuing

During the course, we will ask you to build the pipeline, explore how to troubleshoot, and implement some of the best practices your are learning. To do this, you will work with the pipeline locally and commit/push your changes to GitHub for review. 

See details below for how to get started working with code and files that exist within the course repsository:

---

Open a git bash shell (Windows:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:) or a terminal window (Mac:green_apple:) and change (`cd`) into the directory you work in for projects in R (for me, this is `~/Documents/R`). There, clone the repository and set your working directory to the new project folder that was created:

```
git clone git@github.com:{{ user.username }}/{{ repo }}.git
cd ds-pipelines-targets-2
```

You can also open this project in RStudio by double-clicking the .Rproj file in the `ds-pipelines-targets-2` directory.

:star: Now you have the repository locally! Follow along with the commands introduced and make changes to the code as requested throughout the remainder of the course.
